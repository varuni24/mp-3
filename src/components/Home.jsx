            <AboutH3>Hi! My name is Varuni Gupta!</AboutH3>
            <AboutP>
              I am a senior studying Computer Science at Boston University. I am
              passionate about converting complex data into meaningful insights
              and building software that is both powerful and easy to use. With
              hands-on experience in Python, MySQL, MongoDB, Excel, React, C++,
              AWS, and more, I enjoy working at the intersection of data and
              development. I like solving real-world problems, whether that
              means streamlining data workflows, optimizing systems, or creating
              intuitive user experiences. I am naturally very curious, enjoy
              learning new tools and technologies, and value collaboration as
              much as clean code!
